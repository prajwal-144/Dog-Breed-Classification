# Dog-Breed-Classification
Identifies breed of dog using CNN

 We are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from an image.
 
 For the sake of a more efficient model, we reduced the total number of unique breeds from 120 to 60 and took only 5 unique breeds (classes) into consideration for training the CNN Model.
